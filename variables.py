# my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# # Attempting to modify the tuple
# my_tuple[0] = 10 #This line will raise an error because tuples are immutable
# print (my_tuple)

# Dictionaries

# person = {"Name":"Alice", "Age": 25, "City":"Lagos"}
# car = {"Brand": "Toyota", "Model": "Corolla", "Year": 2019}
# print (person, car)

unique_chars = set ("Hello")
print (unique_chars)
